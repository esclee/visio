It is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provide for the right to a nationality and prohibit arbitrary deprivation of nationality.  \n\nThe National Interim Constitution provides that every person born to a Sudanese mother or father has an inalienable right to Sudanese nationality and recognizes dual nationality; no naturalized Sudanese can be deprived of nationality except in accordance with the law. The Child Act 2010 provides that the state shall guarantee all the legal rights of the child, including nationality and the right to prove his/her affinity. \n\nThe Nationality Act 1994 gives the right to nationality by descent to those who were born to a Sudanese father or mother (or where both mother and father are naturalised Sudanese citizens), thus preventing a stateless parent who is married to a Sudanese from passing on statelessness. However, whilst a father will transmit nationality to his child automatically at birth, nationality can only be passed through the mother automatically where the child is born out of wedlock. Otherwise the mother should make an application to the minister of the interior and provide appropriate documentation (marriage certificate and consent of the father, proof that the mother has legal custody of the child or death certificate.) There is clear scope for statelessness where the mother is unable to produce the required documents and the child cannot obtain the nationality of the father.  \n\nFoundlings of unknown parentage are deemed to be Sudanese by descent. The Act grants men and women equal rights to acquire, change or retain their nationality and confer their nationality on their children. But Sudanese women cannot pass nationality to foreign husbands (including stateless persons), while Sudanese husbands can for foreign wives. \n\nThe head of state has the power to withdraw Sudanese nationality from a person who renounces nationality in some circumstances, but the law does not require the person should first obtain another nationality to avoid statelessness. It is expected that the range of situations in which Sudanese nationality by descent can be withdrawn will be extended to include acquisition of Southern Sudanese nationality (if the current position of the NCP is maintained throughout the ongoing negotiations on citizenship). This will need to be accompanied by safeguards including procedures for ensuring that the individual in question has in fact obtained another nationality and a procedure for confirming citizenship in uncertain or disputed cases. \n\nDuring ongoing negotiations on citizenship in late 2010 and early 2011, there were indications that (north) Sudan might deprive southerners in the north of northern citizenship (and reciprocal action by the south in case of northerners in the south). Further the current indications are that the Southern Sudanese nationality law will extend Southern Sudanese nationality to all individuals from an ethnic group or tribe of South Sudan. Defining nationality along ethnic grounds has a significant capacity to create statelessness due to difficulties with proving ethnicity and the scope for exclusion of certain groups from citizenship status on arbitrary or discriminatory grounds. \n###admin###2a86d3f5-f58b-4381-a101-f1a1862e765a###Summary Protection Assessment

However, the law lacks specific provisions to explicitly protect asylum-seekers and refugees from refoulement. It stipulates several situations under which the GoS may “expel” a refugee. \nArticle 7 of the 1974 Asylum Act provides for the supremacy of ratified international treaties in case of inconsistencies and contradictions with the act itself, which, if implemented, may offer additional protection for asylum-seekers and refugees in Sudan. \n\nThe law is void of procedural details; there is no set of regulations designed to implement the law. Admission and re-admission of asylum seekers is regulated at the first instance by immigration officials and security agents at the border points, who report to COR on the arrival of asylum seekers. UNHCR relied on COR and the local authorities for information on new arrivals and the outcome of asylum applications, and cases of refoulement of asylum seekers and refugees have been reported periodically.  UNHCR is concerned about the number of steps currently involved in the registration process and the lack of access to data on new arrivals. UNHCR is unable to verify how many asylum seekers arrive and leave the country. Often reports of detention or attempts to deport asylum-seekers and refugees reach UNHCR through informal and roundabout ways. \n\nThe situation of documentation and registration in Khartoum has deteriorated as RSD stopped around 2006, and in 2009 registration was also suspended. COR ceased to issue documentation in Khartoum for refugees and started to replace refugee ID cards with asylum seekers’ cards, even for those previously registered in Khartoum. Only those who had undergone joint screening with HCR and COR in 2004/2005 are allowed to maintain their refugee ID cards. The RSD carried currently out by COR in the East does not meet international standards. \n\nIn 2011, the Ministry of the Interior is launching a comprehensive civil registration project which will ensure the civil registration of, and issuance of documentation to, all individuals living in Sudan, including refugees. \n\nThe overwhelming number of new arrivals in Darfur originate from Chad and CAR. Those who proceed to the two established refugee camps (Um Shalaya and Mukjar) are granted refugee status on a prima facie basis after only a very limited interview.\n###admin###4b44b2c0-365c-4b31-b718-f1d9716b8990###Summary Protection Assessment

The Office will continue its pro-active engagement with a range of traditional and ‘new’ partners to support the Operation. \n\nResource mobilization and managing donor relations engages many functions, from Executive Office, Programme and Protection staff in Khartoum where key interlocutors are based, as well as in the Sub Offices. The Office is also actively involved in inter-agency resource allocation and funding structures (Sudan Work Plan and Pooled Funding). The Work Plan is the principal resource mobilization mechanism in Sudan. As lead agency for Protection, UNHCR coordinates assessment, programme design, prioritization and resource allocation processes in favour of needy populations throughout the country within the framework of the Sudan Work Plan and Pooled Funding (notably the Common Humanitarian Fund). With its multi-sectoral assistance programmes in many Work Plan sectors, UNHCR participates actively in coordination, prioritization and resource allocation activities in those sectors.\n	\nThe Office utilizes existing communications mechanisms such as the Donor Principals’ Meeting that is convened periodically by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, to engage donors. And also interacts directly with a range of constituents (donors, the UN leadership, donors and Humanitarian Country Team members). For the East, UNHCR has effectively cooperated with the previous UK Ambassador to Sudan (currently the EU Special Envoy for the country) in creating a “Friends of Sudan” Group, that remains very much alive and a major platform for exchanges between donors and the various humanitarian and development actors. Targeted outreach activities such as briefings on specific issues and field missions are organized alongside collaboration with the national and international media to draw attention to issues affecting persons of concern. Although efforts will continue to be made to attract unearmarked funding, it is expected that the majority of donors will require special funding submissions and reports.\n\nA key priority is to bridge the gap between humanitarian and development interventions, with a focus on creating sustainable solutions by reducing aid dependency and strengthening the capacity of local authorities and grassroots institutions. In this connection, specific efforts are being made to develop partnerships that advance durable solutions and lay foundations to develop exit strategies. In East Sudan, the refugee self-reliance strategy has provided impetus the for active UNHCR engagement with UNDP and the World Bank on area-based joint programming that benefits also host communities, with a view to progressively phasing out assistance to refugees. the Transitional Solutions Initiative (TSI) is critical conduit for channeling support towards this endeavor. Elsewhere, a submission to the Peace Building Fund (PBF) under the Immediate Response Facility (IRF) for activities in Southern Kordofan State is under consideration. PBF is also considering the setting up of a sub-national Peacebuilding and Recovery Facility (PRF) for South Kordofan.\n\nThe durable solutions outlook has created the impetus for engagement on early recovery and sustainable livelihood programmes through a strategic partnership with UNDP’s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR). Negotiations are ongoing regarding the secondment of a senior officer to support field support operations to develop and implement appropriate strategies. A key priority will be to bridge the gap between humanitarian and development assistance, with a focus on creating sustainable solutions through inclusive economic growth, reducing aid dependency and empowering communities, local government and local institutions.\n###admin###a06ea352-1ce5-4b8d-bdb6-d13345f4e663###Operations Plan Document

Each of the field-based regions (East, Darfur, the Two Areas) has a Sub Office that is charged with overseeing programmes and supervising Field Offices and/or Units in the respective operational area. Protection, which carries the additional responsibility for Cluster or sector coordination is decentralized. Day-to-day programme panagement and implementation are decentralized too, with oversight and coordination on a country-wide basis from Khartoum.  Where functions such as HR and Supply do not warrant a full-fledged presence (the Two Areas), these are supported by Khartoum. This arrangement may be reviewed based on developments and the scale of operations in 2012. In all cases, the parent units in Khartoum perform oversight, coordination and quality control to providing strategic guidance to ensure consistency of interventions. Moreover, Khartoum assumes countrywide responsibility for Registration, Resettlement and Statelessness. \n	\nIn East Sudan, Sub Office Kassala will continue to oversee one Field Unit in Gedaref as well as a new presence in Girba that will be established to support protection monitoring and deal with emerging phenomena (new arrivals, secondary movements, etc). In Darfur the office in El Fasher will—as well as conducting liaison with UNAMID, the Humanitarian Country Team and other high level forums—oversee Sub Office El Geneina and six Field Offices (Habila, Mornei Mukjar, Zalengei) in West Darfur; (El Fasher) in North Darfur and (Nyala) in South Darfur. Administration and Programme support services will be provided from El Geneina. With the departure of IOM from Darfur, UNHCR will need to strengthen its presence Nyala and El Fasher to assume lead role for Return and Reintegration /Joint Verification Mechanism. When security conditions permit, a new office should be opened at Jebel Marra to secure deep field presence to respond to new displacement and refugee return in Darfur. In the Two Areas, the newly established Sub Office Kadugli will have responsibility for one Field Unit in Blue Nile State (Kurmuk)\n\nWork force needs in 2012 need to remain stable at minimum and enhanced where possible to respond to new situations, such as more robust presence in the Two Areas, mainstreaming of staff positions that are under the Supplementary Programme in 2011, enhanced protection capacity needs etc. The separation of South Sudan will have no impact on staffing requirements since the region has, for the past two years, operated with an enhanced workforce with fully-fledged Protection, Operations (Programme, Supply, Reintegration) and Admin, supporting field operations under the leadership of a Deputy Representative in Juba, with minimal support from Khartoum.. In 2012 Sudan will have 320 regular staff (69 international and 251 national). Additionally there will be 59 affiliated personnel consisting of 52 international UN Volunteers, two consultants and seven deployees. UNHCR will continue to engage the services of 235 security guards throughout the country who are administered by UNDP.\n###admin###b37aebd1-19ab-4076-84c3-526001dc6875###Operations Plan Document

Southerners in Sudan and Northerners in the ROSS will be vulnerable to push- and pull factors. The flow of returnees to the south, will continue as citizenship issues remain unresolved. However significant backflows can be anticipated due to lack of livelihoods and support in the ROSS and uneasy reception of returnees by communities after their displacement in the ‘north’. The search for reinforced and accelerated internal cohesion and consistency in both Sudan and the ROSS may also result in more control and centre-periphery frictions that could also impact UNHCR’s programmes in the regions. \n\nAn increase in fighting in Darfur would lead to new internal displacement, as seen in 2011. The authorities are likely to continue to promote return (of refugees and IDPs) as the favoured solution. Hindered access for protection monitoring could be a significant constraint. Fighting in South Darfur could produce outflows into ROSS, with challenges related to maintaining the humanitarian character of settlements in remote areas. 2012 is likely to see continued shifting security access situation in Darfur with new displacement in areas where UNHCR has limited access. IDP return and integration will be fragile, constrained by security, rural and urban land tenure issues and lack of livelihoods, necessitating increased engagement on agricultural and urban livelihoods as well as strengthened partnerships with local civil society actors to increase access to insecure areas. \n\nIn the East, historical centre-periphery tensions may increase, and any uprising dealt with firmly although this may lead to internal displacement. The continued flow of asylum seekers from Eritrea is likely to continue, as well as trafficking. Challenges are expected in evolving partnerships in the East particularly from ‘traditional’ partners as the Office seeks to re-define its engagement towards area based development programmes to support a resolution to the protracted refugee situation. It is assumed that support will however continue for conversion of 8 of 12 camps into settlements, that COR will be able to refocus on coordination, camp management and protection, and that the asylum bill will become a reality to support self reliance in the East. \n\nThe Two Areas are likely to be volatile and closely linked to the situation in Abyei. Following elections and Popular Consultations, there could be dissatisfaction amongst SPLM-affiliated populations that could result in tension and further displacement. Nomadic groups such as the Messiriya likely to continue to assert themselves with force, a challenge to movement of Southerners passing through the area and security in the border region. Protection monitoring in Two Areas requires strong protection presence to monitor route safety, and emergency response to new displacement. Peace-building and reconciliation programmes will be important such as area based (urban and rural) livelihood interventions, to also sustain IDP return.\n###admin###01ba0001-b74e-4250-8b70-1aac7b7a7b5a###Operations Plan Document

Asylum-seekers and refugees in Khartoum and other urban areas do not receive food assistance, and only receive limited medical care and educational opportunities for children at primary level. Livelihood opportunities are increasingly limited due to the previously mentioned difficulties in obtaining work permits, and UNHCR has noted an increasing number of refugees who are asking to return to the camps in the East, despite years in Khartoum in some cases, due to economic hardship. There are also limited activities geared towards vulnerable sections of the population such as separated children. \n\nThe change in distribution of food assistance country wide from general distributions, to targeted distributions according to vulnerability criteria, has impacted persons of concern. For example, in refugee camps there are now distributions targeting vulnerable individuals as well as food for work, education, training etc.. programmes. This shift of policy has met resistance from refugees as well as the authorities (COR). Nevertheless the malnutrition rates for refugees in camps have tended to be less than those observed amongst the local communities, especially in the East. \n\nRefugees residing in the 12 active camps in the East are provided with basic services. Sanitation and Shelter in the camps are in need of improvement. Shagarab reception centre is in particular need of attention, falling well below minimum standards. \n\nRegarding education in the Eastern camps, there are not enough schools and too few teachers. At least 100 additional teachers are needed to reach the recommended teacher/student ratio (1/50) of Ministry of Education.. There are also insufficient school supplies. There are up to 100 students in one classroom intended for half the number. Benches made for 4 students are used by 6.\n\nIn Darfur, Um Shalaya refugee camp is managed by UNHCR implementing partner Concern which is responsible for various sectoral interventions, such as NFIs / Shelter, nutrition, livelihood/distribution of seedlings, while UNHCR’s operational partner, Medair, is responsible for WASH and primary health facilities, although a referral system exists for more complicated medical cases. With UNHCR funding, a primary school was constructed and UNHCR paid for the secondary school fees of 3 students, who had done extremely well in the primary school exams, allowing them to continue with secondary education; possibilities to expand this for the next school year are under review.\n\nRefugees with specific needs are also identified and assisted Concern’s activities specifically target women with specific needs (for example livelihoods activities, with women receiving donkeys, sheep, goats as well as seeds (onions, tomatoes, potatoes etc) and tools for agriculture.\n \nThere is no implementing partner assisting refugees in Mukjar Camp as most of the refugees are accessing local host services. For refugees in the border areas, they are encouraged to move to camps if assistance is needed. As of 2011, in addition to one time needs-based assistance/NFI support to border refugees, UNHCR endeavors to provide support to the communities hosting refugees, such as health, water and education. This has been done either through direct UNHCR interventions or by advocating that interventions implemented / funded by others take into consideration the increased needs due to the refugees’ presence.  \n###admin###9aab8366-1198-45e4-ba42-66d228f445e6###Summary Protection Assessment

However, the basis for the IOM database is a (problematic) head count in 2005, which has not been updated since in a systematic manner, while IOM has not been able to access all areas. In general, the level of civil status documentation is extremely low, especially in the rural areas and with IDPs living in the camp – who either never had civil documentation (including birth certificates) and/or do not have the financial resources to pay for required documentation (e.g., birth certificates) and/or distrust of the IDPs towards the government to get registered.  \n\nAlthough foreseen by the 2004 HAC/SSRRC Policy Framework, there has never been a system of IDP registration carried out in Khartoum, White Nile, East or the Two Areas. In 2011/2012, SSSRC will lead the registration of Southern IDPs who are willing to repatriate to South Sudan in Kosti and Khartoum. \n\nIn all areas, legal safety for IDPs continues to be jeopardised by lack of documentation, hindering recognition before the law. In some cases, this gap stems from economic factors (cost of the documents) and affected equally the poor urban population. \n\nIn 2011, the Ministry of the Interior is launching a comprehensive civil registration project which will ensure the civil registration, and issuance of documentation, to all individuals living in Sudan, including IDPs and those potentially at risk of statelessness\n###admin###c1bbc5f0-4151-42b8-b214-be5d4e27e2bf###Summary Protection Assessment

However participation of women, youth and diversity representation in such committees remains a challenge.\n\nDespite their difficult circumstances, urban refugees in Khartoum are largely self dependent. Their self-management potential is demonstrated in the establishment of community schools which allow children to obtain basic education in the Eritrean or Ethiopian curriculum in both English and their respective national curriculum. Later they progress to the Sudanese curriculum with study in Arabic. Teachers’ salaries and running costs (rent, stationery, supplies) are covered through contribution from the students whose families can afford. However, the schools are constructed with temporary materials and lack basic hygienic facilities. Classrooms are hot and overcrowded.

The government’s current encampment policy and lack of documentation places refugees and asylum seekers at constant risk of round-ups, deportation and refoulement. For the majority, local integration options are limited, and resettlement remains the principal durable solution albeit benefiting a tiny minority. The early permissive attitude towards freedom of movement has gradually changed, due to aggravating security situation in the country. This fact led to growing restrictive trends which started to pose a series of limitations to the possibilities of refugees to settle in Khartoum and other urban centres. In general, urban refugees and IDPs endure the same forms of hardship as the urban poor, with limited access to basic services, employment and meaningful livelihood opportunities. Protection risks are magnified especially among women and children who are vulnerable to different forms of exploitation and abuse. The protracted refugee situation in the East, with precarious services and low perspectives as well as the change in the profile of the new arrivals comprised mainly of young males fleeing compulsory military conscription in Eritrea enhanced the urbanization pressure. Most of the new arrivals are already urban or semi-urban and most are young, who tend to look for educational and employment opportunities in the cities. This situation occurs in the overall major urbanisation trend in Sudanese society, evident in Khartoum, as a consequence of economic growth and internal displacement which also affects the refugee population. This phenomenon challenges prevailing assumptions about encampment policy effectiveness as an objective social pressure is taking place. This reality requires a consistent response, as growing administrative restrictions have to be prevented from reaching the level of discrimination, thus affecting refugees’ basic human rights.\n\nAsylum-seekers and refugees in Sudan suffer from a continued lack of documentation which results in increasing instances of arrest and detention. This was even more the case in the lead up to the January 2011 referendum, but has continued since. Furthermore, the right to work is hampered by a complicated formal process to obtain a work permit, which is required for any employment other than in the informal sector. \n\nFGM, domestic violence and sexual harassment are common among refugees living in the camps and urban settings. Cases are rarely reported to the police as most cases are resolved within the family or through the local customary laws and traditional regulations. SGBV survivors risk being stigmatized in their communities and by their families. The level of awareness on issues related to SGBV amongst the authorities and the communities remains a challenge. Response mechanisms can only function properly if the communities and authorities acknowledge the existence of SGBV and are willing to address it. \n\nUNHCR has in recent years seen a rise in the trafficking and smuggling, particularly in the East of Sudan, but also in Khartoum and in a more limited way in Darfur. Kassala and Khartoum have become hubs for criminal groups transporting refugees and migrants across the border into Sudan, through Sudan and into Egypt. Refugees and migrants are often kidnapped, extorted and subjected to grave physical abuse when they rely on smugglers to take them into, through and out of Sudan. The current situation in the Middle East may aggravate this situation.\n###admin###6053055f-77aa-4dba-8504-f74098b6ba5c###Summary Protection Assessment

However, a reservation to Article 26 (Freedom of Movement) of the 1951 Convention is in place.  \n\nSudan is also a party to additional human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the related Protocols and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Sudan has signed the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), but has not yet ratified them. Similarly, Sudan has neither signed nor ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).  \n\nSudan’s asylum policy and practice are regulated by the Regulation of Asylum Act, which entered into force in May 1974. The administrative framework for Sudan’s asylum policy and practice falls under the Ministry of Interior and has been delegated to the Commissioner for Refugees (COR.). UNHCR has been involved with COR and other government departments on drafting the revision of the Asylum Act. However, it is likely that some provisions of concern to UNHCR, such as continued restriction on freedom of movement, will remain.  \n\nSudan has an unofficial policy of denying access to the asylum process for asylum-seekers from an Arab League member state, with the exception of nationals of Somalia. This has resulted in several instances of refoulement in 2011. \n\nThe Commissioner for Refugees (COR), the designated national authority under the Minister of the Interior, is the authority to grant asylum seekers due and fair access to procedures, registration and documentation in Sudan. However, major shortcomings persisted in the activities of COR. Undue restrictions to the freedom of movement of asylum seekers and refugees, their registration and reluctance to issue documentation remained in place. Ensuring refugees’ access to adequate livelihood, work and employment, education, health and other services therefore remained a challenge. Access to naturalization remains formally a right with very little if any practical access, access to asylum procedures clearly deteriorated as COR halted the registration of refugees in Khartoum in 2010 and an agreement on the RSD process remains a pending issue since 2007. \n\nThe protection situation for asylum-seekers and refugees in Sudan, particularly those who are undocumented or who attempt to move without the necessary permits, is very precarious, with increased instances of detention and several reported incidents of refoulement. \n\nAdmission and re-admission of asylum seekers is regulated at the first instance by immigration officials and security agents at the border points, who report to COR on the arrival of asylum seekers. UNHCR relies on COR for the statistics and details of the asylum seekers, particularly in Eastern Sudan.  A continued and sustained need for capacity building, in particular of border officials is a major area of focus. In Darfur, physical access to territory by asylum seekers is not largely restrictive due to the remoteness of borders, which are often unmonitored by government officials. There are often continuous cross border movements between the country of origin and the country of asylum, which may, in some instances, make it difficult to 'fix' the population. Access by UNHCR to persons of concern is often limited by remote locations and subsequent security risks/considerations. \n###admin###18ef60b0-40c3-4637-a7e2-b8302ac50f3b###Summary Protection Assessment

The situation is complicated by the fact that many people do not have identity documentation (birth certificates, national identity documents), which may cause problems with proving entitlement to the nationality of one or the other state. Citizenship arrangements may affect the estimated 1.5 million Southerners in the North and around 80,000 Northerners believed to reside in the South. Other groups at risk include tribes living close to the North-South border, couples/families with mixed backgrounds, orphans and children of unknown parentage. \n\nUNHCR therefore advocates for the principle that no individual should lose their Sudanese citizenship unless it is confirmed that they have obtained the citizenship of another state. UNHCR also supports a right for individuals to choose between the citizenship of South Sudan and the Republic of Sudan where they have an appropriate connection to both states. This will help facilitate durable solutions and prevent mass expulsions which are prohibited under international and African human rights regimes. UNHCR also supports a transitional period during which individuals continue to enjoy the rights attached to Sudanese citizenship and have sufficient time to confirm their nationality, make fully informed decisions about residence, and regularise their status through other means if they are not entitled to citizenship in their place of residence. \n\nUNHCR also supports the right of Sudanese refugees in countries of asylum to return voluntarily to their place of origin in either the South or the North.

However, in Darfur, after several years of sustained international assistance as well as ongoing conflict – it has been observed that overall community self-management structures (traditional and emerging) remain weak, which has also impacted on self-reliance and community based livelihood initiatives. This is not helped by fluid population movements due to protection risks, that undermine the sustainability of return, or the emergency law that prohibits gatherings. Participation of women in community management is low due to socio-cultural norms which limit women’s role in decision making in public life. \n\nIn the absence of social and economic safety nets in rural areas, many Sudanese are drawn to urban centers, such as Khartoum where there are relatively better access to social services and livelihood opportunities.  INGOs active in Khartoum have established community-based networks to evaluate situations, report, and refer cases and also work closely with Community-based Organisations and local NGOs. However, the expulsion in March 2009 of many of the INGOs was a major setback in ensuring community participation as well as the limited access of the remaining humanitarian organisations to the IDP communities. Limited support has been provided through Community-based Organizations that still have access to IDP communities and departure points. INGOs/CBOs have also set up referral networks and UNHCR assists them to evaluate the   situations and refer vulnerable cases   \n\nIn 2011 UNHCR initiated interventions in IDP communities in the East and the Two Areas and encouraged community participation and self management. UNHCR has completed an IDP profiling exercise in the East and has started a similar exercise in Khartoum, Blue Nile and South Kordofan. The aim of the profiling is to better understand the composition of the IDP populations, their capacity to integrate and to identify any protection concerns. The profiling will assess the initiatives of the communities and build upon the programs of the current humanitarian and development actors in these areas. From initial information gathered, the IDP communities work mainly in the informal sector where they face severe competition for employment. The level of poverty and food insecurity has risen sharply in recent years. For Southern IDPs, they lack access to documentation and the barriers to accessing employment opportunities have decreased. \n###admin###79ec0a11-43a4-4b3d-80ac-26392583ffb6###Summary Protection Assessment

Landlessness and homelessness resulting from unclear urban planning policies and lack of economic means to ensure documents and procedures for land acquisition continue to be concerns for IDPs from North Sudan. There is currently no housing policy able to guarantee basic shelter. Standards of living are inadequate, due to poor basic services and infrastructures. The lack of a strategy of urban poverty reduction limits adequate livelihood opportunities. The result is exploitation and limited self reliance opportunities. The willingness of Southern IDPs to return to the South of Sudan has been partly fuelled by a lack of clarity on citizenship and fear of restricted access to legal, land/house ownership, education and basic services. \n\nThe EAST has the highest malnutrition rates in the country, and the global acute malnutrition rates exceed the emergency threshold of 15%. The region has high under-five mortality rates and the population is vulnerable to HIV. Access to safe drinking water has an average of 36.4%. The region faces huge food security and livelihood gaps. Continuous inadequate crop harvest, flooding and droughts have contributed to chronic food shortages. The average gross enrolment rate for basic education is 58%. All these factors impact on IDPs populations in the East as well as local communities. \n\nWeak government structures, lack of funds and proper utilization of existing funds in the TWO AREAS have contributed to poor infrastructure- health, education, roads and transport etc. Post war rehabilitation of water, health, education, electricity needs are enormous. In general, IDP populations from the North have integrated into host communities and have needs stemming from poverty and experience limited marginalisation. Southern IDPs have expressed an increase in discrimination, including access to documentation, employment and basic services post CPA. A large majority of Southern IDPs are without any form of documentation thus limiting their access to local services. \n\nIn Darfur, IDP populations face serious constraints in accessing firewood fuel. The depletion of firewood poses serious security risks to IDP populations due to far traveling distances to collection areas where there is lack of law and order, exposing women and children at risk of violent attacks. In some areas, alternative/efficient fuel sources have been introduced, but supply does not meet demand. In addition, deforestation for firewood creates serious environmental degradation. Alternative fuel sources are therefore needed as a matter of urgency. \n\nHealth and water/sanitation remain urgent concerns for population survival and well being. Reliable/ updated HIV figures are not available for most part of Darfur though the State National Aids Programme (SNAP) through Health Ministry aims to strengthen its free ARV delivery to IDPs, refugees and host communities.\n\nPoverty also hinders access to basic health and education services of IDPs, whether rural, camp based or urban, as not all clinical services are free of charge, while the authorities are not paying many of the teachers, resulting in the parents having to contribute to their  ‘incentives’ by paying fees.  \n\nThe change in distribution of food assistance country wide from general distributions, to targeted distributions according to vulnerability criteria has also impacted IDPs, and has met resistance by IDPs and the authorities. In Darfur this is further compounded by the lack of access agencies have to IDPs in insecure areas to distribute food. Nevertheless the malnutrition rates for refugees in camps have tended to be less than those observed amongst the local communities, especially in the East. \n###admin###ed87693c-c96c-49d6-9eb3-e8acd43c0bba###Summary Protection Assessment

The Governors of Sennar and El Jazeera States agreed to consolidate the 3 Suki refugee camps into Fau V camp and endorsed the strategy to transform camps into productive villages integrated into the social fabric of the region. The State Line Ministries welcomed UNHCR’s goal of shifting from assisting long-staying refugees to promoting area-based development programmes that target both refugees and host communities. Reception conditions in Shagarab refugee camps were improved through the construction of communal shelters, latrines and a centre for unaccompanied minors. However, much remains to be done. A prison monitoring system was put in place along with legal representation of asylum seekers and refugees to prevent refoulement. 8,000 of the 16,500 refugee children of school going age (48%) were enrolled in 17 UNHCR supported schools. The construction of 13 classrooms and rehabilitation of primary schools helped to alleviate overcrowding. Dormitories, latrines and four new classrooms were constructed to increase access to secondary education.\n\n• DARFUR: UNHCR completed the verification and registration of camp-based refugees. Basic educational infrastructure, nutritional and livelihoods assistance were provided to targeted refugee and host communities in Um Shalaya and Mukjar Refuee camps along with support to local health facilities. UNHCR also monitored areas of new internal displacement where security access allowed. In North Darfur, UNHCR and partners responded to the displacement in Zam Zam camp providing non food items and construction of community shelters.  Rehabilitation and reintegration activities were carried out in South Darfur (Abuajoura, Donkey Dereisa) and in West Darfur (Um Kher, Garsila, Forobaranga), restoration of basic services and infrastructure in North Darfur (Tukumare, Khartoum Jadid) and livelihoods related support in Zalingei and Habillah areas, including in four camps and elderly centers in West Darfur (near El Geneina, Tendelti, Kreneik). 235 UNHCR protection and return monitoring missions reported to the Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM) and to Protection Cluster Working Groups. In all three Darfur states there are now functioning Return and Reintegration Working Groups (RRWG).\n\n• KHARTOUM: UNHCR cooperated with Government in drafting its new Asylum Bill and advocated on pending issues such as employment of refugees, withdrawal of Sudan’s reservation to article 26 of the 1951 Convention relating to freedom of movement of refugees, and  formulation of an urban refugee policy. The dynamics of the CPA brought about a renewed appreciation of the potential for statelessness—a core UNHCR mandate issue—among southerners in the north whose numbers run into the millions. UNHCR initiated advocacy efforts with UNMIS and the African Union High Level Implementation Panel, providing technical advice to the CPA parties on citizenship to support an alignment with international standards and Sudan’s human rights obligations so that individuals do not become stateless at succession. \n\n• TWO AREAS: UNHCR established a presence in Kadugli, State capital of Southern Kordofan, and co-chairs the Protection Sector (the authorities chair), with the Child Protection and GBV sub-sectors led by UNICEF and UNFPA. Southern Kordofan is both a place of return and a major transit zone for populations returning southwards. Urgent interventions were made in January 2010 to rescue returnees who came under attack. A monitoring system is now in place to prevent such occurrences by re-routing convoys through safer areas and working with the authorities to ensure their safe passage. The way station north of Kadugli is being rehabilitated for transiting returnees. Assessment missions have been conducted to identify at-risk groups among the IDP population. \n###admin###b204521b-60d8-44fd-93f7-3271cd89c0b1###Operations Plan Document

The only exception is that regulations make provision for issuing of a travel document to stateless persons in Sudan in order to allow them to travel outside of the country. Legal protection for stateless persons is inadequate – e.g. there is no definition of statelessness in domestic law, no provisions for differential/beneficial treatment for stateless persons compared to foreign nationals, and no national procedures to determine statelessness. The emphasis for UNHCR will be on preventing statelessness therefore UNHCR advocates for procedures which will allow individuals to confirm their nationality status where this is uncertain or disputed with the aim of ensuring that all current Sudanese nationals have at least one nationality after Southern independence.  If cases of statelessness do in fact result following Southern independence, UNHCR will need to advocate for procedures and laws to identify and protect statelessness persons. UNHCR has offered its services to the Governments of North and South Sudan in establishing nationality and administrative procedures to prevent statelessness. An expert was seconded to the Government of South Sudan in January 2011 for a six month period. \n\nThe level of nationality/civil status documentation is insufficient to prevent de jure/de facto statelessness, despite the importance in the National IDP Policy of documentation as an obligation of the government. There is a widespread absence of legal documentation such as national identity cards and birth certificates among the population, including millions of IDPs and former IDPs, and the cost is prohibitive for such populations on the brink of survival. Large sectors of the population therefore do not have documentation to prove their Sudanese nationality, birth on the territory of Sudan or family links with Sudan. \n\nIn view of the secession of South Sudan and the introduction of new citizenship arrangements, it will be particularly important that populations at risk of statelessness are in possession of official documentation, in particular birth certificates for new borns and age assessment certificates for older children and adults. IDPs of Southern Origin are a particularly significant target group in light of the longstanding obstacles that they face to obtaining documentation and the current large scale movement of such populations to South Sudan from where they risk being unlikely to obtain documents. \n\nIn 2011, the Ministry of the Interior is launching a comprehensive civil registration project which will ensure the civil registration, and issuance of documentation, to all individuals living in Sudan, including IDPs and those potentially at risk of statelessness. \n###admin###9dfa8886-b686-4863-a3f7-76c3613c4f2b###Summary Protection Assessment

The Commissioner for Refugees (COR) is the government agency responsible for all refugee matters in Sudan. COR carries out refugee status determination, camp coordination, protection and general coordination. The Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) is the principal government interlocutor regarding internal displacement. \n\nUNHCR has built working relations with a diverse range of constituents to advance UNHCR’s protection advocacy agenda, including regular contact with national and local authorities, UN leadership, donors, the Humanitarian Country Team members, Embassies, the African Union including the High Level Implementation Panel for Sudan, the Arab League, and other high level actors within the different peace processes. Coordination and engagement in these fora are considered as core responsibilities of the Office. \n\nAs lead agency for protection countrywide, UNHCR has assumed a more predictable approach vis-à-vis internally displaced persons. UNHCR acts as the liaison between humanitarian protection actors, the Government and various components of the peacekeeping mission in order to maximise responses for the protection of affected populations. UNHCR is active in protection sub-clusters (gender-based violence, child protection, etc.) which are led by sister UN agencies, and was co-lead for Return and Reintegration along with IOM. In West Darfur, UNHCR is the lead source of information for the Joint Verification Mechanism and High Level Committee on return and reintegration at country level. In 2011 it has been suggested that UNHCR take over from IOM as lead agency for returns in North and South Darfur; this would require an enhanced protection presence in these locations.\n\nThe Sudan Work Plan is the principal inter-agency programming and resource mobilisation tool in Sudan. UNHCR has activities in education, health, food security and livelihoods, non-food items, protection and water-sanitation-and-hygiene sectors reflecting the multi-sectoral nature of UNHCR’s programmes. UNHCR participates actively in prioritization and programme design both as lead agency for protection as well an active member of other sectors to ensure that refugees and other persons of concern are not marginalized. It is a challenge for UNHCR to participate in all working groups and a programme based approach to the CHF would better reflect UNHCR’s multi-sectoral programme based interventions. UNHCR also participates in the 2009-2012 UNDAF for Sudan to mainstream displacement issues in national development programmes, with lead role for coordinating cross cutting protection issues. \n\nThe Friends of East Sudan informal contact group, chaired by the Ambassador of the United Kingdom, has become an important forum for donors, humanitarian and development actors to focus attention on East Sudan. Unlike Darfur and South Sudan which both have peacekeeping missions that maintain international attention on the respective issues, the East had been somewhat sidelined. UNHCR is an active member of the Friends of the East, and has been able to highlight refugee issues  and garner support for durable solutions initiatives through this group. The East has benefited from special allocations from the Common Humanitarian Fun (CHF) at the behest of the RC/HC. UNHCR has also forged partnerships with the State authorities in the East, with a view to handing over responsibility for all schools in refugee camps to the State Ministry of Education. Gedaref State is also interested in taking over the management of basic services in refugee camps\n###admin###a970e071-5a63-4beb-8e6d-3c1f49c3347a###Operations Plan Document

On some occasions this led to secondary displacement where populations lacked sufficient means to return South. Limited infrastructure in South Sudan including poor roads mean that it is often impossible to travel to and within the South in the long rainy season. Post independence, Southerners in the North may face increased local pressure in the form of denial of access to services, restrictions on enjoyment of property rights, reduced employment prospects and possibly even physical threats from local communities and/ or authorities. Such scenarios could just as well result in increased internal displacement within N Sudan as well as greater numbers of returns to the South. \n\nPrevious experience of certain IDP sites in Khartoum indicates that southern IDPs/former IDPs may resort to violence. (Soba, Mayo and Jebel Aulia are already classified as “security threat” locations after the killing of Soba police officers during clashes relating to evictions of IDPs in the context of urban planning.) These sites could give rise to risks of militarization and compromising the civilian and humanitarian character of IDP camps. Measures for effective law enforcement, maintenance of law and order and prevention of forced/under-aged recruitment will be needed to prevent violence in IDP sites in Khartoum and elsewhere if the south secedes. Access of humanitarian agencies including the UN (especially international staff) was problematic due to bureaucratic restrictions by the government, hindering protection monitoring and interventions by the humanitarian community, however local staff have recently had no access difficulties.\n###admin###eab9daf3-8c65-47a1-bc33-e08b733c525c###Summary Protection Assessment

As such, UNHCR’s presence in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Abyei will been strengthened to respond to the surge in movement towards the South and to engage in peace building and conflict prevention in this highly volatile region. The Office stands ready to work with all actors and maintain a response capacity to emerging concerns including internal and/or cross-border displacement as well as return.\n\nCountrywide, UNHCR will continue to perform its mandate responsibilities for refugees and statelessness, as well as its protection lead responsibilities within the inter-agency collaborative framework. The phenomena of new arrivals, secondary movements, return movements and fresh displacement will require the strengthening of protection capacity. UNHCR will continue to advocate for the promulgation and implementation of policies that protect refugees, prevent their refoulement and guarantee meaningful solutions to their plight. UNHCR will work with the authorities on citizenship issues and support civil registration that should result in the issuance of documentation to of refugees and IDPs. \n\nThe trend of urbanisation among refugees and IDPs mirrors national preferences in Sudan and challenges prevailing assumptions about displacement and the ultimate return of displaced persons to their (often rural) communities of origin or ancestry. Policies that recognize the productive role of refugees and IDPs in urban settings will go a step towards reducing protection risks and enhancing solutions. \n\nIn the East, UNHCR will continue to maintain a dual focus on promoting refugee-self reliance while advocating for constructive measures to prevent and respond to secondary movements. New arrivals will continue to require support in the form of shelter and basic services as well as innovative programming to respond to the widely different needs of an urban bred population. The UNHCR-UNDP-World Bank cooperation involving inclusive area-based programming approaches, now in the design phase, will continue to gain momentum. Resettlement will be pursued as a protection and solutions tool for segments of the refugee population and as strategic leverage in creating space for local integration for the majority of the refugee population.\n\nIn Darfur, UNHCR will continue its protection lead role responsibilities. While it is hoped that the peace process will deliver dividends, continuing conflict does not augur well for the future. Meanwhile, durable solutions perspectives will have to take into account the transformation of lifestyle choices that the seven-year conflict has produced. It is to be expected that some IDPs may wish to integrate in the (urban) context of displacement. Potential for return will continue to be explored and conflict-sensitive area-based interventions planned within an inter-agency collaborative framework. Community-based assistance will continue in refugee hosting areas. Support will be extended to Sudanese refugees wishing to return from Chad. \n\nNotwithstanding the diversity of operational contexts, UNHCR’s approach is to maintain countrywide orientation towards durable solutions in Sudan. Partnership will be a central theme, recognizing that even where UNHCR has a unique mandate for protection, evidently the Office has not the competencies or capacities to address the challenge on its own. In striving to secure solutions, gaps in protection and basic needs must continue to be addressed where they fall below international standards. Moreover, the Office needs to stand ready to respond to new situations. These strategic orientations are aligned with UNHCR’s Global Strategic Priorities. \n###admin###59bf55f5-a89f-4835-b9d4-002ecabed0c9###Operations Plan Document

Each of the Parties faces political, economic and social challenges alongside a critical need to lay foundations for constructive neighbourly relations. Outstanding issues include north-south border demarcation, nationality and citizenship, assets and liabilities, wealth sharing (including oil contracts and environmental issues), water, wealth, civil service, the Joint Integrated Units, etc. Talks between the CPA Parties held in Khartoum, Juba and Addis Ababa to resolve all outstanding issues have made no progress despite efforts by regional and international players. \n\nSouthern Kordofan and Blue Nile State remain flashpoints for potential conflict and displacement and will continue to require robust engagement by the Government and the international community. The CPA granted the Two Areas a Popular Consultation process aimed at promoting peaceful coexistence whilst allowing minorities to retain their cultural identity through special economic, political and social arrangements. However, competition over transit rights, water and land continue to drive local conflicts, fuelled by entrenched mistrust and political manipulation. \n\nIn Eastern Sudan, population flows from neighbouring countries continue amid increasing indications that the region has become a transit area for refugees and migrants. There has been a rise in trafficking and smuggling, as persons from different countries in the region enter Sudan and travel to Khartoum, the Middle East and Europe. Limited southwards movements of refugees have also been observed. Of utmost concern are the dangers associated with irregular travel, exposing refugees and migrants to kidnapping, extortion, physical and in particular sexual violence. Data from interviews indicates that every month dozens of migrants and refugees are kidnapped in Eastern Sudan.\n\nFor Khartoum’s growing population of refugees, the lack of documentation creates a constant risk of round-ups, deportation and refoulement. Urban refugees endure similar hardships as the urban poor, with limited access to basic services. Legal status, lack of documentation and lack of economic opportunities put refugees in a more vulnerable situation. Protection risks are magnified among women and children who are vulnerable to different forms of exploitation and abuse.  \n\nIn Darfur, inter and intra rebel as well as rebel-Government fighting continue to create insecurity and large-scale new displacement. The Doha Peace talks sponsored by the Qatari Government are continuing alongside concerted efforts to convene the Darfur Political Process and the All Darfur Conference at local, State and regional (Darfur) level. The Government of Sudan, UN and African Union High-Level Implementation Panel for Sudan agreed to create an enabling environment to support consensus building on matters as determined by the people of Darfur. Among the key issues being considered for creating an “enabling environment” is the lifting of emergency laws to allow greater discourse in the search for peace The Government announced a new Peace and Development Strategy for Darfur, including a possible restructuring of administrative boundaries that could create five provinces out of the present three as one option. Significant numbers of IDPs remain on the move, relocating, returning only seasonally or for limited periods to cultivate land, due to the insecure environment. \n\nThe Governments of Sudan and Chad have entered into negotiations and signed an MOU in 2010 for the return of the refugees from the Chad. UNHCR has requested its involvement in the process, and looks forward to a positive response from both Governments.\n###admin###4e89b192-2c1a-4793-9e6c-1f5383a67b49###Operations Plan Document

The range of protection challenges in the post-CPA era, ranging from possible statelessness, to new refugee flows entirely through a single entry point. Greater engagement is foreseen with the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Humanitarian Aid Commission and others. \n\nWithin the UN, while it is as yet unclear what shape coordination structure will take in the post-CPA era, UNHCR will continue to maintain a strong presence under the leadership of the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, with an overall protection lead role as our main driver. Coordination and engagement in inter-agency forums are considered as core responsibilities of the office and must be resourced accordingly. Currently there are two peace keeping missions—UNMIS established to support implementation of the CPA and UNAMID the hybrid UN-AU Mission in Darfur—and complex UN coordination mechanisms. UNHCR will continue to work within the country team and particularly in very close partnership with its traditional humanitarian partners (WFP, UNICEF, OCHA) while expanding its engagement with UNDP in a results-based and field-oriented approach. \n\nThe assumption of the countrywide protection lead role has translated into a clear, more predictable and consistent engagement with IDPs, where this is adequately resourced, with UNHCR acting as liaison between humanitarian protection actors, the authorities and peacekeeping missions with the goal of maximizing responses for the protection of affected populations. In Khartoum, the East and the Two Areas (Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States) the Office will continue to concentrate mainly on IDP return issues, i.e. registration, protection monitoring at departure points and en route, limited assistance to vulnerable populations and coordination and partnership. In Darfur, the Office will continue to stand ready to respond to new displacement within an inter-agency collaborative framework. \n\nUNHCR will continue to act as the liaison between humanitarian protection actors and various components of the peacekeeping mission, as will as with the Government in order to maximise responses for the protection of affected populations. As leader of the Darfur Protection Cluster, UNHCR will continue to collaborate with the sub Cluster leads for gender-based violence (UNFPA) and Child Protection (UNICEF). In 2011 UNHCR may take over the lead of the Return and Reintegration Working Groups from IOM throughout Darfur. The Office will continue to be an active player on the Joint Verification Mechanism and High Level Committee on return and reintegration at central level.\n\nA key priority is to strengthen partnerships that can support a transition towards the inclusion of persons of concern in the interventions of development actors, as well as actively engage  local partners at State and grassroots levels as a means to enhancing outreach to populations of concern. In East Sudan, the UNHCR’s refugee self-reliance strategy has provided impetus for an active engagement with UNDP and the World Bank on area-based joint programming that also benefits host communities, with a view to progressively phasing out assistance to refugees. In tandem, the just completed Assessment of Development Needs of Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Eastern Sudan is the first step in identifying opportunities for World Bank involvement to address development needs of the target groups in partnership with UNHCR, the government and other interested partners. \n\nUNHCR also participates in the 2009-2012 UNDAF for Sudan to mainstream displacement issues in national development programmes, with lead role for coordinating cross cutting protection issues. \n###admin###f4611bfa-811b-4c44-ac17-262502ff75a6###Operations Plan Document

USD 450,000 core basic needs also reinstated to prevent deterioration of standards in camps.  \n\n•	Increased core protection capacity in Darfur, East, Khartoum and Two Areas for to address gaps and new situations for 2012 such as prevention of statelessness (P3, consultant USD 320,000), enhanced presence in El Fasher and Nyala in Darfur to take on ex-IOM  Joint Verification Monitoring and leadership of Return and Reintegration Working Groups (2 P3, 2 G6, 2 G5 USD 531,750  +USD 150,000 Ops – total USD 681,000), enhanced protection presence in the Two Areas (P3 USD 192,000) and protection monitoring in the East to meet basic protection standards (2xP2 USD 315,000). Total USD 1,508,000. \n\n•	Start up budget for the new Transitional Solutions Initiative for the protracted refugee situation in the East, in order not to lose momentum and political capital. The majority of self-reliance and TSI initiatives will be part of an extra-budgetary ""Project"". Of the USD 15m TSI project, a portion is included in OL, however USD 1m of the total 2.9m education component requested.\n\n•	New countrywide civil registration project with the Ministry of Interior with PI and expanded legal aid networks to enhance protection situation of refugees, IDPs and persons at risk of statelessness with registration/issuance of documentation. Funds for resettlement, management of Kosti way station for IDP returnees, assistance to vulnerable IDPs, as well as urban refugees were pushed out of OL to accommodate new situations. Total Ops required for Khartoum PPG/pillars USD 2.6m (statelessness USD 1m, refugees USD 720,00,  IDPs USD 880,000) \n\n•	Reinstate minimal durable solutions component of the Darfur programme for IDPs pushed out of OL for 2012.  In order to support IDP return, livelihood projects are required of sufficient scale to have an impact. Without agricultural projects the sustainability of return is undermined. USD 1.3m.\n\n•	Minimum response for refugee return from Chad or fresh displacement in Darfur, a new situation not possible to absorb in the OL. The PPG Returnees was de-activated due to resource constraints, but also as an integrated area-based approach to refugee and IDP return can initially taken (should significant numbers return, the PPG/pillar should be separately resourced). Support also needed for new IDP displacement, thus of the USD 4 million identified for some 20,000 returns, USD 1 million required to assure a response to refugee return and new displacement on a limited scale. \n\n•	ABOD requirements for Darfur linked to ex SB and protection capacity positions mainstreamed in 2012. USD 800,000 ABOD required. Further USD 311,000 for IT equipment in Khartoum. Could not be mainstreamed without direct assistance. \n	\n•	Enhance capacity to respond to fresh displacement and IDP return in Two Areas. Profiling of vulnerable IDPs, NFI, and shelter for returnees and support for new IPs in the area for protection monitoring are prioritized above OL for immediate implementation. USD 940,000\n"###admin###7a0a763b-fc3b-4aa7-81b8-5a49b1a5b8e5###Operations Plan Document

In May 2010, UNHCR assumed the nation-wide protection cluster lead for IDPs following the phase-out of the UNMIS Protection of Civilians Unit. UNHCR is also active in a number of sub-clusters, in particular those focusing on SGBV and child protection, both at regional level and centrally. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coordination at the different levels. \n\nThere is potential for increasing hostilities after the separation of the North and South Sudan on July 9th, 2011. This may trigger population displacements within North Sudan and across the border, in particular affecting the Two Areas. Meanwhile, the situation in South Kordofan and Blue Nile State remains a major cause for concern, with the potential for an explosion of conflict over state level elections, popular consultations and resource distribution. In the recent months, tension and violence in Abyei has led to displacements and may contribute to instability in the Two Areas.  \n\nFor Darfur, a major issue affecting the protection environment for IDPs is the limitation or even denial of access of humanitarian organisations to IDP locations as well as potential areas of return, combined with harassment, and in some cases kidnappings, of humanitarian workers. This has as a consequence that much needed humanitarian interventions, including provision of food and other basic services are not provided to IDPs, or IDP returnees.  \n###admin###1c078fc7-fed6-4bdb-a248-cd9241fb6efd###Summary Protection Assessment

Khartoum and most parts of North Sudan are assessed as likely to remain calm and stable. Similarly, the situation in East Sudan is assessed as likely to remain calm unless internal tensions increase due to recurring feelings of disenfranchisement (similar to those that lead up to the ESPA in 2006).  In Darfur, the security situation is forecast to remain fluid with undercurrents for spontaneous violence, upsurge in criminal insecurity and civil strife. It is unlikely that there will be significant improvements in accessing currently inaccessible areas as the Government continues to pursue a military option to the uprising in the region. Any additional deterioration of the present conditions will undoubtedly have significant implications for future programmes. The context of security theme planning therefore hinges on the current and forecast security posture, that sustained political divergence and the festering militia and banditry activity will continue to exert spontaneous security pressures during the period under planning. While the main threat in Darfur relates to criminal activities, notably banditry and car hijackings, there has been a growing trend in Darfur of kidnappings targeted at aid workers and this is now built into our planning parameters as a “realistic assumption” in view of our extensive field coverage – and the characteristics of the new security level system, concentrating on “how to stay” with all the risks to staff safety inherent in so doing. The Two Areas present a serious challenge in terms of staff, operational, partners and assets safety due in part to the fact that UNHCR is establishing its presence for the first time in the area but most significantly, that the area is a melting point between North Sudan and the newly independent state in the South and most of all because of the many unresolved issues relating to the popular consultations, DDR and Citizenship and potential instability and violence around these issues. \n\nUNHCR is an active member of the UN Security Management System and continues to actively participate in the SMT/ASMT meetings and joint efforts aimed at Security Risk Assessments and Management under the UN Inter Agency Security Management System. Program planning and implementation will be preceded by assessed program criticality and the Operation will endeavour to meet its obligations in terms of MOSS and MORSS. Funds will be allocated to meet these requirements at the planning stage. The operation will also supplement its hardware of MOSS/MORSS with the software of information and networking. Optimal use will be made of available international and National Safety staff.\n\nUNHCR has International Safety Advisers and National Field Safety Assistants posted in offices countrywide. All staff are expected to have completed the Basic and Advanced Security in the Field course before arrival and to attend mandatory security briefings on arrival. They also undertake a two day Sudan-specific Safe and Secure Approaches to Field Environments Training (SSAFE).  All staff apply for and obtain security clearances prior to any travel within and out of the area of operation. All Mission vehicles to be MOSS compliant, properly registered as per SOP 18, staff on mission must comply with convoy/road mission procedures stipulated in SOP 19, Vehicle tracking and convoy procedures. There are regular updates of staff lists, contingency planning including relocation/evacuation plans, response to critical incidents, MEDECA/CASEVAC. Measures for office, accommodation and warehouse protection are in place, including physical protection of premises, recruitment, equipment, and training of security guards, implementation of appropriate access control procedures and fire safety measures. \n###admin###8970722b-2cec-45c6-9f1e-ef05d49faad0###Operations Plan Document

Following an overwhelming vote in favour of secession, the South will declare independence on 9 July 2011. The secession of South Sudan raises important issues under UNHCR’s statelessness mandate. In particular UNHCR is concerned to ensure new citizenship arrangements in the Republic of Sudan and in South Sudan are designed to prevent statelessness.\n\nDuring ongoing negotiations on citizenship, there were indications that (north) Sudan might deprive southerners in the north of northern citizenship (and reciprocal action by the south in case of northerners in the south). Further the current indications are that the Southern Sudanese nationality law will extend Southern Sudanese nationality to all individuals from an ethnic group or tribe of South Sudan. Defining nationality along ethnic grounds has a significant capacity to create statelessness due to difficulties with proving ethnicity and the scope for exclusion of certain groups from citizenship status on arbitrary or discriminatory grounds.\n\nBased on indications from both Governments and the progress of the negotiations so far, populations at risk of de jure/de facto statelessness in Northern Sudan include over a million southerners residing in North Sudan plus over a million IDPs/ex-IDPs of Southern origin. The majority of IDPs are thought to be in Khartoum but a sizeable proportion also reside in N-S border states (including S Kordofan, Southern Blue Nile, South Darfur) and tens of thousands are thought to reside in the East of Sudan. From late 2010 to early 2011, approximately 300,000 individuals of Southern origin returned to South Sudan from the North. The number of returnees reduced from Feb/ March 2011 when the Government of South Sudan stopped organized transport to the South due to lack of funds.\n\nOthers at risk include individuals of mixed N-S origin, tribes that live close to or spread across the N-S border, and orphans and unaccompanied children and Sudanese expatriates (refugees or migrants) who may have difficulty proving nationality where one or more generations have been born abroad. Other groups in Sudan are not affected by Southern independence but nonetheless remain at risk of statelessness including individuals born close to other international borders, pastoralist groups in Western, Northern and Eastern Sudan and individuals without documentation. \n###admin###d3cf2908-1128-43c5-b946-121ac187a696###Summary Protection Assessment

Lack of coordination coupled with the vast geographical area complicates efforts for community mobilization on such a scale. Participation of women in community management is low due to socio-cultural norms which limit women’s rights. In the absence of social and economic safety nets in rural areas, many Sudanese are drawn to urban centers, such as Khartoum where there are relatively better access to social services and livelihood opportunities. \n\nMore local initiatives are present though. INGOs active in Khartoum have established community-based networks to evaluate situations, report, and refer cases and also work closely with Community-based Organisations and local NGOs. However, the expulsion in March 2009 of many of the INGOs was a major setback in ensuring community participation as well as the limited access of the remaining humanitarian organisations to the IDP communities. Limited support has been provided through Community-based Organizations that still have access to IDP communities and departure points. INGOs/CBOs have also set up referral networks and UNHCR assists them to evaluate the   situations and refer vulnerable cases   \n\nIn 2011 UNHCR initiated interventions in IDP communities in the East and the Two Areas and encouraged community participation and self management. UNHCR has completed an IDP profiling exercise in the East and has started a similar exercise in Khartoum, Blue Nile and South Kordofan. The aim of the profiling is to better understand the composition of the IDP populations, their capacity to integrate and to identify any protection concerns. The profiling will assess the initiatives of the communities and build upon the programs of the current humanitarian and development actors in these areas. From initial information gathered, the IDP communities work mainly in the informal sector where they face severe competition for employment. The level of poverty and food insecurity has risen sharply in recent years. For Southern IDPs, they lack access to documentation and the barriers to accessing employment opportunities have decreased. \n###admin###3f98641d-c8f0-44b3-a50c-db37ceb0c901###Summary Protection Assessment

In Sudan the National Policy on Internally Displaced Persons is the national legal framework for IDPs in Sudan and the norms have been developed from the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The National Policy foresees the right to return voluntarily to one’s place or region from where the person fled from. It also mentions resettlement where the displaced person can choose another area to live in other than his or her original area or region. The Policy recognizes the right of movement, family reunification, and access to food, water and sanitation, shelter, education, access to documentation, and possession of property, as well as civil and political rights, participation in political affairs and practicing one’s religion, economic and employment opportunities, access to justice and all the rights of citizens stated in the Constitution. \n\nSeveral challenges remain for the Government of Sudan in terms of applying the National Policy on IDPs. Displacement continued in 2010 and the rights of the IDPs are often not respected. In many areas, especially Darfur, the government has not been able to assist the IDPs and they cannot fulfill basic rights such as education, health, and food security.\n\nIn all areas, legal safety for IDPs continues to be jeopardised by lack of documentation, hindering recognition before the law, civil/political rights, and access to services and economic opportunities for local integration. In some cases, this gap stems from economic factors (cost of the documents) and affected equally the poor urban population. The lack of agreement on citizenship and the process to obtain it, is likely to widen the gap for Southern IDPs who wish to remain in North Sudan. Some Southern IDPs have expressed fear over an increase in discriminatory attitudes towards them if they remain and the negative impact that will have on their ability to obtain access livelihood opportunities, basic services and documentation. \n\nThe dynamics of the CPA resulted in a renewed attention to the protection needs of persons of Southern origin residing in the North by late 2010. In 2011, UNHCR is fully engaged in identifying and advocating for the protection needs of the estimated 1.7 million Southern IDPs remaining in the North including persons stranded at departure points in Khartoum and Kosti, as well as those in transit to the South of Sudan. In addition UNHCR has increased its capacity to monitor and respond to the needs of IDPs in the Two Protocol Areas, as well as IDP returnees to South Kordofan. \n\nIn the Darfur region some 2.4 to 2.7 million persons remain internally displaced. In 2011 new displacement occurred due to violent clashes between rival nomadic groups as well as violent clashes between forces of the Government of Sudan and various rebel groups. Physical security of IDPs, as well as land access issues, are a concern in some areas of Darfur. Nevertheless small numbers of IDPs do opt to return to places of origin, though many more remain in camps or other locations of displacement. \n###admin###9f6afc93-4254-4853-8f76-06a92361a7f0###Summary Protection Assessment

Geographical coverage has thus been extended to Southern Kordofan, which is a flashpoints zone on the frontline with South Sudan. As a result, UNHCR has a minimum presence in areas of the country where displacement issues are critical. Within those regions, the priority is to prevent a deterioration of standards of protection and assistance to persons of concern.\n\nFor refugee programmes, which are not “clusterized” and thus depend almost entirely on UNHCR’s interventions, protection interventions that address the needs of new arrivals, prevention of refoulement, children, SBGV and camp security were prioritized. Protection activities are staff intensive. Moreover, provision is made to subsidize the Government refugee agency. Similarly, basic services have been prioritized with the aim of ensuring continued access to health, education, shelter, food, water and sanitation. Refugee’s well-being cannot be compromised, particularly in situations where malnutrition rates remain unacceptably high, water distribution is below international standards, where access to health care is critical, and where there are serious risks of SGBV.\n\nIn IDP programmes, protection—the main priority—is a staff-intensive enterprise. As countrywide lead agency, beyond the classical functions of monitoring and maximizing responses, coordination responsibilities demand great amounts of staff time related to advocacy, programming and resource allocation through inter-agency collaborative frameworks under the leadership of the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator. Regarding basic services, UNHCR interventions aim solely to fill gaps in inputs provided by concerned sector leads, particularly in areas where the Office has an advantage of presence. \n\nProtection and legal interventions that have a country wide impact were maintained, such as work to prevent statelessness which is a GSP and Bureau priority. Support costs were reviewed to ensure the minimum protection and operational presence. Lessons learned from 2011 show that where positions were cut, even when subsequently reinstated when additions resources became available – this has a delayed impact on persons of concern, since it takes time to fill positions. \n\nDurable solutions initiatives would, in the absence of adequate resource levels be reduced to a token level with minimal impact. A meaningful improvement in the situation could not be expected, with consequences for our credibility vis-à-vis authorities, donors and beneficiaries. The Offices anticipates to circumvent such a scenario through active engagement of development actors and the promotion of area-based approaches with the long-term perspective of mainstreaming displacement issues in national development programmes\n\nDifficult decisions had to be made, prioritizing the relative importance of investing more resources in one or the other core area – both GSP and Bureau Priorities. As a result, while the Global Strategic Priorities are generically covered in the sum of the Sudan operation as a whole; when disaggregated gaps may occur at individual population planning group level. It is evident looking at the results of prioritization that in the face of resource deficiencies one could not expect to achieve all of UNHCR’s stated objectives in Sudan. The population figures in Sudan are significant. Interventions of scale are required to really change a situation rather than ‘maintain’ a sub-optimal status quo or prevent a further deterioration of standards. \n###admin###cb56c789-7bdd-4d7f-933d-14eb620ee249###Operations Plan Document

For other refugee populations, namely Chadians in Darfur, Ethiopians and a small number of mixed nationalities, voluntary repatriation may be an increasingly viable option. However at present, no large-scale repatriation is envisaged, it will be undertaken on a case by case basis. \n\nLocal integration has in the past not readily been accepted by GOS, although in practice an important number of refugees in the East and in Khartoum who arrived in Sudan decades ago, are locally integrated. Nevertheless naturalisation, the ultimate proof of local integration, is hard to obtain, even if the necessary legal framework (five years of continual legal residence in Sudan) is in place. \n\nResettlement is a durable solution for a small number of refugees in Sudan. In 2011, UNHCR expects that 1500 refugees will benefit from this durable solution, mostly in cases with legal and physical protection needs, women at risk, survivors of violence and torture and medical needs. Family reunification is also an important avenue whereby refugees in Sudan are able to access a durable solution. It is expected to increase resettlement in 2012 with a view to targeting those refugees in a protracted refugee situation in the East for whom local integration is not a viable solution, as well as recent arrivals presenting protection needs, or who are particularly vulnerable, such as those with medical needs or disabilities.\n###admin###19b5ae82-c859-465a-a655-7da0cebcb56a###Summary Protection Assessment

All these factors contribute to an environment where providing security from violence and exploitation is a major challenge. In addition, the most vulnerable amongst the population, be they IDPs or local population, struggle for survival.\n\nThe lack of rule of law including impunity provisions for Government officials and in particular sexual intimidation and abuse continue to impact host and IDP populations in Darfur. Women and teenaged girls are especially vulnerable to violence and exploitation during firewood collection and when they are engaged in farming activities in the field often far away from the camp. \n\nEarly/forced marriage, FGM, domestic violence and sexual harassment remain common in IDP and hosting communities. Prevailing customary practices are gender discriminatory. Reporting and access to justice is hindered by fear of ostracism and stigma. Authorities remain extremely sensitive to allegations of GBV, which continue to be linked in their minds to ICC issues, and inadequate support structures are in place to deal with SGBV cases. \n###admin###4ab3601e-fbf6-457b-aea3-2352ac1b18eb###Summary Protection Assessment

The majority are long-stay refugees who fled their home countries up to 40 years ago. There are also significant new arrivals; some 2,000 persons per month over the last 2 years. This trend is expected to continue and could escalate in 2012 if the situation in Eritrea deteriorates. Between 80% and 90% of the new arrivals move on to Khartoum and beyond within two months of arrival, in search of better prospects. \n	In Khartoum, the 30-40,000 urban refugees comprise new arrivals as well as refugees registered in the East who migrate to the city. The outlook for durable solutions is limited: voluntary repatriation and local integration are not options; resettlement benefits only a few individuals on a case by case basis. \n	In Darfur, refugee numbers are estimated at around 40,000, mostly from Chad.  The majority live in West Darfur among local populations in the border areas. In addition, 7,339 refugees reside in Um-Shalaya camp and 638 in Mukjar camp. There are small numbers of refugees from the Central African Republic in South Darfur (mainly in Um Dafaug). For 2012 the planning figure remains stable. \n\nRefugee Returnees – planning figure 20,000\n•	The Governments of Sudan and Chad have started negotiations on the voluntary return of Sudanese refugees in Chad to Sudan. There are over 260,000 Sudanese refugees in Chad who originate from Darfur. Planning figures vary; UNHCR projects some 20,000 returns while the authorities are projecting higher figures. Voluntary return on such a scale has not yet materialized with only low numbers returning spontaneously in the first quarter of 2011. \n\nIDPs – estimated 4.1-4.4 million (of which 300,000 IDP returns) 	\n	In Darfur, the Humanitarian Country Team has agreed on an estimation of IDP figures (as a range) in the three States of Darfur. The IDP figure for Darfur is estimated to be between 2.4 million and 2.7 million, representing over one-third of the total population. Between 1.2 and 1.9 million of the IDPs receive some form of humanitarian assistance and protection. \n	For 2012, UNHCR has a planning figure of some 300,000 IDPs of southern origin who may return to South Sudan. Many IDPs who wish to return cannot unless supported to do so. The surge of return around the 2011 referendum outpaced the capacity and resources of the Government of South Sudan to respond. Some back-flow of IDPs to the North was observed subsequently.  In 2012 it is expected that return movements will continue. \n\nPersons at Risk of Statelessness – estimated 1.7 million \nCitizenship arrangements will impact the estimated 1.7 million Southerners in the North and around 80,000 Northerners believed to reside in the South as well as pastoralist and nomadic populations that migrate across the north-south border, and mixed origin couples/families, orphans and children of unknown parentage. It is not yet clear who will remain a citizen of Sudan or become a citizen of newly independent South Sudan from 9 July 2011. If an individual loses citizenship of the Republic of Sudan without obtaining citizenship of South Sudan, they may become stateless unless they have the nationality of a third state. That many people do not have identity documentation (birth certificates, national identity documents) complicates their entitlement to citizenship. \n###admin###c49dbdef-cd68-4a38-b825-bda450392e81###Operations Plan Document

Numbers of “backflow” movements in early 2011 serves as an early warning to ensure complete information is in place before individuals elect to return. \n\nOrganized return movements for IDPs from the North to the South supported by SSRRC, ceased in early 2011. Since SSRRC/GoSS and state organized returns commenced in October 2010 until end March 2011, IOM reports that 261,028 persons have returned to South Sudan.  UNHCR is providing technical support to SSRRC, GoSS, HAC and CVHW in registration, convoy management and developing information campaigns to enhance the safety and security of Southern IDPs in Khartoum and Kosti who have demonstrated willingness to return to the South. Many Southern IDPs in Blue Nile, South Kordofan, South Darfur and White Nile have also requested SSRRC to support their movement to the South. UNHCR will advocate for persons who are vulnerable in all areas to be prioritized for assistance. \n\nLocal Integration - This solution needs to be promoted for southern IDPs in the north who express a wish for local integration – e.g. residency rights including more secure land tenure for those who have been allocated plots of land, final land ownership documents, identity cards etc.  Whilst protection monitoring activities indicate that a high proportion of Southern IDPs wish to return South, the office has also seen sporadic South - North movements by Southerners returning to the North due to lack of livelihood opportunities, security concerns and allegations of harassment by the authorities in the south. In the absence of pressure, it is thought that some southern IDPs will choose to remain in the North in view of the protracted nature of their displacement and the comparative availability of jobs, education, basic services and better standards of living in Khartoum as opposed to the south.    \n\nThrough the adoption of an area and community-based approach in the Two Areas, Blue Nile and South Kordofan, UNHCR supported the early reintegration of returning refugees and of returning IDPs, to ensure a sustainable process of return. The main interventions are focused on support to the rehabilitation of infrastructure, to fostering livelihood opportunities, and improving basic services (water, health, education facilities) as well as peace-building activities.   \n\nIn Darfur, the creation of conditions conducive to durable solutions, through effective advocacy and coordinated “do no harm” project interventions that will facilitate peaceful co-existence is a key concern of UNHCR.  \n\nIn Darfur, the voluntary return of IDPs has received significant attention over the past year from the government, who put forward a Darfur Strategy focusing on returns in late 2010, UNHCR continues to stress that return is one of several possible solutions supported by UNHCR, and that voluntary return must be carried out in conditions of safety and dignity and in accordance with accepted international standards. At the same time, there is widespread acknowledgement—among government and international actors—that a significant percentage of IDPs may choose to remain permanently in areas of origin and locally integrate. In either case, there are significant obstacles regarding land tenure that need to be addressed, including differing interpretations of the native land administration, potential changing land ownership patterns in areas of displacement, land occupation in abandoned villages, restitution/compensation issues, and possibilities for future land-share among return and pastoralist communities. \n###admin###33f73acd-84e6-4f47-af77-d22e27113bff###Summary Protection Assessment

It is expected that the international community, through an effective and robust peacekeeping presence will continue to support both states to maintain security and stability in the new border areas, and work towards settling outstanding issues that could foment conflict and instability if left unresolved (border demarcation, nationality and citizenship, assets and liabilities, oil, water, wealth, civil service, the Joint Integrated Units, etc.).\n	\nThe phenomenon of secondary movements of Eritreans, Ethiopians and Somalis through East Sudan is likely to grow and undergo frequent changes in direction. For example, the ongoing unrest in Libya has created a blockage in the main transit zone for movement towards Europe. Given its location, Sudan will continue to be affected by secondary movements both as country of first asylum and transit country and the resultant protection challenges need to be tackled as part of a regional approach, also in an effort to at least prevent hazardous movements. Critically, the approach to secondary movers must be carefully calibrated to ensure that local integration efforts for the ‘old caseload’ are not undermined. \n\nThe Governments of Sudan and Chad have embarked on negotiations for the return of refugees from both sides as a result of a peace agreement signed between the two countries. It is expected that Sudanese refugees who are currently living in border areas in Chad could begin to return home in 2011. \n\nThe ongoing unrest in North Africa, particularly Libya, has directed attention to some 500,000 Sudanese migrants who reside in that country. In 2011 UNHCR participated in the air evacuation to Khartoum of more than 13,000 migrants in a special joint operation with IOM and has also engaged monitors to report on overland returns to Darfur. There is concern by some observers that the continuing conflict in Libya could result in a proliferation of arms in the Darfur region.\n###admin###016823f9-7db8-4047-9aba-6fa171f16f8c###Operations Plan Document

It affects mostly part of the Syrian Kurd population which, since 1962, is deprived of nationality and therefore of access to certain rights and services. The affected population nonetheless carries some documentation. In spite of previous indications of willingness to resolve the issue on the authorities’ part, no concrete measures were taken in 2010. Moreover, the socio-economic situation of the Syrian Kurd population has further deteriorated because of the drought affecting North East Syria and efforts were made by the authorities and UN agencies to alleviate this situation. \n\nThe President has just issued Decree No. 49 granting Syrian citizenship to part of the stateless (Kurd) population in Hassake Governorate. This positive development may concern a group of roughly 150,000 individuals. \n\nStatelessness also affects children of Syrian women married to foreigners insofar as there are restrictions on the possibility for them to transfer nationality. This could lead to statelessness if, for a reason or another, the children cannot access their father’s nationality. This issue has been raised publicly by some local NGOs and Syrian parliamentarians, but no progress has been achieved so far. Numbers of persons possibly affected by this situation are unknown and those given by NGOs are difficult to verify. However, UNHCR has come across a handful of cases which would have been resolved should this possibility existed.  \n\nUNHCR has dealt with a few cases of asylum seekers from other countries in the region facing nationality issues. Some were recognized as stateless and processed for resettlement. Developments in Kuwait with regard to the Bidoon issue could have a positive impact on some of the cases encountered by UNHCR in Syria.\n###admin###bf77cbb3-9e0e-41d1-a71b-ffa54d7d89ab###Summary Protection Assessment

Those living in the Governorate of Hassake are almost entirely dependent on agriculture and cover all their needs from the income they receive from their employment/economic activity in this domain. Hassake being one of the least developed Governorates of Syria, there are limited services available for nationals and non-nationals residing there.\n\nAjanib and Maktoumeen are unable to access government health care and must pay for all health services. Ajanib and Maktoumeen cannot work in the civil service or in the Army. The children of Ajanib can access primary education but find it more difficult to access secondary and higher education, although they can study at universities whereas Maktoumeen children’s education is very restricted with attendance at higher education practically impossible.\n\nIn 2009/2010, the UN Country Team in Syria, in particular FAO and WFP, implemented an assistance program for drought affected areas in Syria. The Governorate of Hassake benefited from this program. Although the implementing partners kept no specific record of those individuals who were assisted (received food rations), UNHCR estimates that at least a number of them should have been stateless Kurds.\n\nUNHCR strategy on the issue of statelessness in Syria, particularly the issue of stateless Kurds and children of Syrian mothers, is to bring the issue forward albeit in a cautious way so that the sensitivities of the national security apparatus are not disturbed. This implies low profile activities including information gathering, mapping of issues and actors, linkages with regional initiatives, presentations to key interlocutors in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, embassy staff based in Damascus as well as visiting delegations from different countries. The second pillar of the Office strategy, which was to select well documented cases to be assisted with naturalization or nationality conformation procedures, could not really be carried out in 2010, due to the difficulty in establishing contacts with relevant cases. \n\nStateless persons, other then Kurds and children of Syrian mothers, who do not otherwise qualify for refugee status are provided by UNHCR with statelessness certificates and included in the assistance packages UNHCR is extending to refugees (including legal protection, medical care, food and non food items).\n###admin###9b8c30eb-4548-4ac8-8b13-781f73d1548f###Summary Protection Assessment

However, Syria has a long way to go before the basic preconditions and mechanisms facilitating real local integration are in place. For the time being an interim solution which should be pursued is the gradual improvement of their legal status and enjoyment of rights guaranteed to all individuals (be they nationals of the country or not) by the various human rights instruments ratified by the Syrian Arab Republic. For other categories of stateless, the ideal durable solution is resettlement since their numbers are small. There is little prospect of return to their country of former habitual residence, while local integration prospects are even weaker than for the Kurdish Maktoumeen or Ajanib. Therefore, 10 stateless persons (2 cases) from other country of habitual residence than Syria have been submitted for resettlement in 2010. Nineteen stateless persons (2 cases) departed in 2010. This durable solution provides for firmer legal status and better access to rights for the beneficiaries in the countries of resettlement. ###admin###12b89e68-f100-4f3c-843a-e0597435aac4###Summary Protection Assessment

In 2010, only a very small number of them opted for UNHCR voluntary repatriation assistance. For most Non-Iraqi refugees, the situation in their country of origin is also deemed unstable and not conducive to return – notably for Somali, Sudanese and Afghan refugees. \n\nAlthough only a very small number of Iraqi refugees opted for UNHCR voluntary repatriation assistance, it must be underlined that a much high number of them have spontaneously returned. Indeed, out of the over 40,000 Iraqi refugee population de-activated in 2010, it is estimated that at least 70% have actually returned, although only on a temporary basis. During a survey conducted in the first part of 2010, the main reasons provided for not wanting to return were the general insecurity there, the fear of being targeted by armed groups (e.g. militia), the lack of house to return to as well as the lack of employment opportunities and services.\n\nWhile the Office’s return policy has remained at a facilitation stage, the planned opening of an “Emergency and Returnee Rehabilitation Office” in Damascus by the Iraqi Ministry for Displacement and Migration (MODM) will be followed up closely. The aim of this Office will be, among others, to provide specialized vocational and professional training programs to refugees which may help them find job opportunities upon return to Iraq. It is the stated MODM strategy to encourage voluntary and dignified return of Iraqis. \n\nIn the meantime, the provision of skills training and other livelihood opportunities to refugees features also among UNHCR main priorities for the coming years, to equip refugees for a better future as well as help mitigate the negative effects of their prolonged displacement.\n\nThe large Iraqi refugee presence in the urban centres of Syria is considered a heavy burden on the available public services and the host communities, not sufficiently shared by the international community. Local integration is therefore officially not an option, whether for Iraqis or Non Iraqi refugees. This position may explain the temporary character of the residency granted to refugees as well as the absence of the right to work. \n\nWhile resettlement is currently the most viable solution for a large number of refugees from Iraq, and a concrete sign of international solidarity and burden sharing in the Syrian context, most European countries have indicated that they do not intend to accept more Iraqis from the Middle East. Other countries, like Canada, have actually increased their resettlement and private sponsorship quotas for Iraqis. \n\nIn 2010, the resettlement needs were estimated to be about 40-45,000 persons, and close to 13,000 Iraqis were submitted. There is a significant acknowledged backlog which will carry over into 2012. This results in refugees with resettlement needs continuing to wait until their case can be seen. Measures are in place to prioritize cases which need to be seen on a more urgent basis and who may face specific protection problems or have other vulnerabilities, including women at risk, LGBT, severe trauma cases, etc.\n###admin###94fbea49-5521-41b8-87c6-da9fbaf795ab###Summary Protection Assessment

However, it has ratified, with reservations, the Convention on Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the two Covenants.\n\nThere are at least four categories of stateless persons in Syria; some of the Kurds (the vast majority), persons of Armenian or Turkish origins who have been living in Syria for a long period of time (numbers unknown), those who came “recently” from Iraq or Kuwait to Syria (essentially bidoons) and those who could be stateless as a result of the impossibility of Syrian women to transfer nationality when married to foreigners (numbers unknown).  Since there is no legal framework in the field of statelessness, none of these categories is provided with standard documentation by the Syrian authorities.\n\nStatelessness in Syria affects mainly part of the Kurd population living in the north of the country. In 1962, the Syrian government carried out a special census in the governorate of Hassake. Kurds had to prove that hey had lived in Syria since at least 1945 or otherwise lose their Syrian citizenship. It is estimated that there are some 300 000 Kurds found not to be nationals of Syria falling equally in the categories of Ajanib (foreigners) and Maktoumeen (not registered). These two categories reflect the two different ways Kurds were found not to be Syrian nationals. While the Ajanib are those who during the 1962 census have been determined not to be residents of Syria before 1945, the Maktoumeen are those who did not show up during the census of 1962, who could not register their birth in the civil records due to lack of status of the parents, or who settled in Syria after the census. Kurds belonging to these two categories are issued different types of documentation and have access to a limited number of rights and services. Stateless Kurds from Syria remain in a precarious legal and socio-economic situation, which has even been worsened by the drought affecting the north east of the country.\n\nThe President’s statement in his inauguration speech (upon his re-election in 2007) that there would soon be a solution for the stateless populations in north-eastern Syria did not lead to any concrete legislative or administrative measures. The Syrian authorities are extremely hesitant to share information on the legal status, the measures contemplated, if any, to resolve the statelessness issue or other political developments affecting a significant percentage of the Kurdish population. The UNHCR Office in Syria has been informed in 2009 that a Circular Note was issued by the Ministry of Interior prohibiting the share of information on stateless Kurds by governmental agencies or other state bodies with foreign entities. In addition to this, a decree was enacted in September 2008, which restricts the ability of people living in the border areas of Syria to sell or purchase property without prior approval of the authorities. \n\nBarring very recent developments, the protection environment in Syria with regard to stateless persons is not very favourable. The space for action on this issue for UNHCR is also rather limited, unless appropriate partnerships with local and other actors, including political actors, are established. \n###admin###c2c06cd6-f196-4578-8f07-dfe1f6e8a504###Summary Protection Assessment
